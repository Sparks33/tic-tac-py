# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Py Game

This Python program implements a text-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid. The game includes features such as displaying the game board, validating player moves, checking for a win or draw condition, and prompting players to play again.

**Game Overview:**

The program starts by displaying the title "Ultimate Python Tic-Tac-Toe" along with a stylized separator. The game board consists of nine empty boxes labeled from 1 to 9, presented in a 3x3 grid format.

**Gameplay:**

1. Each player is represented by either "X" or "O". Player "X" starts the game.
2. The current state of the game board is displayed after every move.
3. Players are prompted to choose a position (1-9) to place their marker on the board.
4. The program validates the chosen position, ensures it's not already occupied, and updates the board accordingly.
5. The game continues with players taking turns until one of the following conditions is met:
- A player wins by having three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.
6. After the game is completed, the program displays the final state of the board and announces the outcome (win or draw).
7. Players are then asked if they want to play again. Responding with "yes" or any answer starting with "y" will initiate a new game round, while any other response will end the game.

**Features:**

1. Displaying the game board using stylized formatting for better visualization.
2. Checking for win conditions by examining rows, columns, and diagonals on the board.
3. Verifying player inputs and handling occupied positions.
4. Repeatedly playing new game rounds based on player preference.
   
**How to Run:**

2. The game will display the initial board and prompt players to make their moves.
3. Players take turns until a win or draw occurs.
4 After each round, players are asked if they want to play again.
